# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator
The project perform arithmetic on very large integers beyond built-in data types. Numbers are stored in a doubly linked list. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo using manual digit-wise operations with carry, borrow, and long division logic, emphasizing pointers, dynamic memory, and modular programming.
